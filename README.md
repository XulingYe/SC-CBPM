# SC-CBPM

SC-CBPM (Smart Contract for Construction Business Process Management) is a framework proposed by Xuling Ye et.al, to allow *Cascaded and Upgradable Smart Contracts for Blockchain-Aided Construction Business Process Management*

## Instructions
All the USC and CSC solidity files can be directly executed via Remix IDE: https://remix.ethereum.org/ 

To reproduce the validation scenarios:

1. Open Remix IDE and upload the Solidity files listed below.  
2. Compile the contract(s) using the Solidity compiler (version 0.8.x or higher).  
3. Deploy the contract(s) on a local (e.g., Ganache) or test Ethereum network (e.g., Sepolia).  
4. Follow the comments and example inputs within each file to simulate contract execution.
